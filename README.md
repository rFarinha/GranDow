# GranDow- Simple Multilanguage Arduino Digital Clock

My grandmother keeps forgeting about the day of the week for her pills. Unfortunately all digital clocks I can find showing the day of the week are in english. This simple project with just 3 components is cheap and easy to build.

Feel free to edit and create your own clock.
